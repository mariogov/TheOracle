//! Batch queue statistics and summary types.

//! This module provides statistics tracking for batch queue operations,
//! using atomics for thread-safe concurrent updates.

/// All fields use atomics for thread-safe concurrent updates.

/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// # use context_graph_embeddings::batch::BatchQueueStats;
/// let stats = BatchQueueStats::default();
/// stats.record_request();
/// stats.record_batch(10, 5000); // 10 items, 5ms wait
///
/// let summary = stats.summary();
/// assert_eq!(summary.batches_processed, 1);
/// assert_eq!(summary.requests_received, 1);
